<h2 id="why-spring">Why Spring and Spring Boot?</h2>
<p>Java is one of the major programming languages- if not <em>the</em> major programming language - for enterprise software development. It is designed
    to be easy to read and maintain, and hard to make mistakes in; it nowadays has vast, varied, and for a large part
    free libraries
    that can provide almost any functionality imaginable, and its performance is for most purposes quite acceptable.
    This is not to say that you cannot or should not use other languages for enterprise application development, but
    Java
    is generally a solid choice.</p>
<p>The power and vastness of the Java ecosystem has a downside: you can pick and choose from many
    libraries and frameworks, but not all of them will work nicely together. Of course, with sufficient experience and
    skill and experimentation you can always make things work, but it is of course useful if a developer can use his
    or her time to add functionality to a product or remove bugs instead of struggling with conflicts between libraries.
</p>
<p>The Spring project was originally meant as a tool to make it easier to write larger Java applications by using
    a technique called "dependency injection", which means that instead of every class having to create the
    objects to fill each field, fields can be initialized automatically when needed.</p>
<p>To clarify: in a simple Java program you can have a Room class which has a field of type Door. When creating
    the room, the room itself must either initialize the door itself (Door door = new WoodenDoor()), or obtain the door
    via a setter (void setDoor(Door door)) or constructor (public Room(Door door)), where the constructor would be
    the preferred choice, as otherwise it would be too easy to make a mistake and build a room without a door (or
    rather, a room where door is null).
</p>
<p>
    This approach of object construction and manual injection works fine in small projects, but in large projects it can
    become unwieldy. If an architect wanted to replace all WoodenDoors by MetalDoors, there may be hundreds of places
    in the code to change; and while this should not be a large problem for a modern IDE ('Find and Replace') any
    reviewer
    would still need to check hundreds of lines of commits to be certain of the correctness of the replacement;
    and it also feels fundamentally wrong to let one simple
    choice (WoodenDoor should be replaced by MetalDoor) affect hundreds of lines of code. Additionally, if you inject
    the type via the constructor, you may have to pass the item through multiple layers of constructors to reach
    the object that finally needs it (a House needs to pass the Door to Floors, which need to pass the Door to
    Rooms...), which produces lots of low-value 'plumbing code', especially in large applications. Can we do better?
</p>
<p>
    A way to address the problems of 'excessive plumbing' and/or simple requirement changes causing huge code changes is
    the technique of dependency injection (DI). Dependency injection allows you to specify in each class what kind of
    components you need (say a Door), and somewhere else in the programme you specify that if the compiler sees an
    unassigned Door field somewhere, it should be filled with say a freshly created (or shared!) WoodenDoor. Later
    you'll see code like</p>
<pre>
    @Autowired
    private ItemRepository itemRepository;
</pre>
<p>
    This means that Spring will look for a class that can act like an ItemRepository, creates an object of it (or
    fetches a pre-made object of that type from storage) and lets the itemRepository field point to it. This is
    of course very convenient!
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, the advantages of Spring over the functionality built into Java by its creator Sun made it very popular, both for
    application developers and framework developers. The first public release of the Spring project already had
    functionality to more easily interact with databases than the 'normal' Java way, and to serve webpages; it has
    only grown over the past decades and now includes libraries for security, microservices, reactive programming
    and much more! Spring's many <a href="https://spring.io/">sub-projects</a> allow a developer to (in principle)
    build even complex functionality relatively easily. Spring is therefore
    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/java/">dominant</a> in the Java ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    Spring Boot is a Spring project that makes it easier to create Spring projects! It even has a helper website,
    start.spring.io, which you'll use in the next section.
</p>

<h2 id="use-spring-init">Using Spring Initializr to set up the project</h2>

<p>Creating a Spring project is most easily done with Spring Boot. Spring even provides a website, the "Spring
    Initializr",
    on <a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a>.</p>
<p>I go to the start.spring.io website and fill in the fields, like setting a name for my project
    (SpringReactTutorialProject),
    an artifact (springreacttutorialproject) giving it a group (in my case org.ericwubbo) and a description.

    Note that the artifact, as per best practice, is lowercase only. Since it would be inconvenient if the main class
    would
    simply be called `Springreacttutorialproject` (just starting with a S, the rest NOT camelcased), it is helpful to
    override the name to look like a proper Java class that won't give warnings in IntellJ about misspellings.
</p>
<p>Some of my settings</p>
<ol>
    <li>Project: <em>Maven</em> (standard would be Gradle Groovy). Why change from the default? Definitely, Gradle has
        been 'adopt' <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar/tools/gradle">since 2013</a>, and nowadays
        ThoughtWorks even <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-sg/radar/languages-and-frameworks/gradle-kotlin-dsl">
            recommends</a> the Gradle Kotlin variety. However, the power and flexibility of Gradle comes at the price
        of complexity, and most documentation in my experience still uses Maven examples. With the current relative
        absence
        of Gradle Kotlin on Stack Overflow, and my own not-that-developed Gradle knowledge, Maven will be fine enough;
        if I
        ever plan to make a big, complex project, preferably with the help of others, Gradle-Kotlin would seem the way
        to go; but for a proof-of-concept and for exploring Spring itself, Maven it will be for this project.
    </li>
    <li>Language: <em>Java</em>. Groovy seems
        <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=java%2Ckotlin%2Cgroovy">barely used anymore</a>,
        Kotlin is definitely an interesting option, but as I'm teaching Java at the moment, a Java example project is
        nicer for demoing purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
        other defaults: accepted without comment. Fine for a first project.
    </li>
</ol>
But we still need some dependencies: Spring Initializr's value is mainly in how easy it is to connect useful libraries
and frameworks. I'll pick six, this time.
<ul>
    <li><em>Spring Web</em>: After all, we need to create some kind of API for a full-stack web app!</li>
    <li><em>Spring Data JPA</em>: Any nontrivial app requires storage, and databases are usually best for that.</li>
    <li><em>PostgreSQL Driver</em>: We also need an actual database to connect to via JPA, PostgreSQL seems at the
        moment
        (2023) <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#databases">the most-used database</a> and is quite loved
        as well!
    </li>
    <li><em>Spring Security</em>: In most web apps, you need to remember users.</li>
    <li><em>Lombok</em>: Library to make Java code shorter, which is generally a bonus.</li>
    <li><em>Spring Boot DevTools</em>: Handy library that allows hot reloads.</li>
</ul>

I press the "Generate"button, download the zip-file, and unpack it into a subfolder of my Development folder.

<h2 id="open-the-project">Open in IntelliJ</h2>
I open the project in IntelliJ, and let Maven do its stuff. I build and run. It runs, though aborts with a message that
it cannot find a database. I'll fix that later. First I'll commit.

<h2 id="push-to-github">Push to GitHub</h2>
I choose VCS from the main menu, press on Share Project on GitHub, and follow the instructions.
