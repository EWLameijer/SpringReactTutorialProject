<body>
<dl>
    <dt>API</dt>
    <dd>Application Programming Interface; a set of functions that you can feed data to, and which will
        give you data back. Is in contrast to a normal user interface, where the inputs are mouse clicks and button
        presses
        instead of regular text data or numeric data.
    </dd>
    <dt>artifact</dt>
    <dd>The 'name' of this particular project as it would appear in the package; typically a package would be called
        <code>nl.itvitae.springreactdemo</code>. In that package name, <code>springreactdemo</code> would be the (name
        of the)
        artifact, <code>nl.itvitae</code> would be called the group. By default, Spring Initializr creates an
        application with a main class whose name is the same as the name of the package, just starting with a capital
        letter. If you don't want that, so if you don't want a 'Springreactdemo' main class but say a 'SpringReactDemo'
        main class, you need to specify that in the 'name' field of the Initializr.
    </dd>
    <dt>connection (database)</dt>
    <dd>A DBMS actually acts like a server, not only in enterprise situations where you often have specialized computers
        which are called "database servers", but also when you run a database locally. The DBMS listens to a certain
        port,
        and any HTTP requests to that port will return some reply from the database. Like in the case of web servers,
        the
        process is as follows: software does a request to the correct address, as given by the so-called connection
        string
        which tends to be in your application settings. In this example application, the connection string is
        <code>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/springreactdemo</code>, which indicates both the port the DBMS is
        listening to (port 5432) and the name of the database (the jdbc:postgresql indicates the protocol, the
        formatting of requests to the database; while web browsers generally use http and https, the current application
        is using the jdbc:postgresql protocol). The database server will then keep a connection open, meaning that it
        will, at least for some time, allow data to go back and forth from itself to the client (which here is the
        Spring application), without the relatively time-consuming process of opening a connection. You could compare
        this to logging in to a government website; for security (and to conserve resources on the government server)
        you are logged out after 15 minutes or so, but as it would be extremely cumbersome to have to enter your
        username and password and check those every time you go to another page on the government website, the
        government server allows traffic from your http address to enter it without additional checks, at least for the
        set time period. This is exactly how a database server and database connection work as well.
    </dd>
    <dt>controller</dt>
    <dd>A controller is the name for a class that takes input from outside (typically a user via a web browser, or
        another program calling the API of your program), and returns some kind of response. A controller fulfills a
        similar role as a spokesperson of a company: it receives questions/requests, and gives answers. Of course, it
        can consult with other classes in the application, usually those classes are called "services" or "service
        classes".
    </dd>
    <dt>create-react-app</dt>
    <dd>The original way to easily create a React app; nowadays, solutions like Vite and Next.js are better for this.
    </dd>
    <dt>database</dt>
    <dd>a database is usually a collection of data, each database is isolated from other databases, like books
        on a library shelf. Databases are generally created and managed by a so-called database management system
        (DBMS).
    </dd>
    <dt>DBMS</dt>
    <dd>database management system. Basically, a DBMS is software to create, query, update and delete databases.
    </dd>
    <dt>dependency</dt>
    <dd>The name of a class or library on which a certain class or software package depends, and therefore usually
        needs to be downloaded to your computer and packaged with the final product. In Java, dependencies on libraries
        are usually managed by specifying which libraries/packages you need via a Maven or Gradle configuration file.
    </dd>
    <dt>Dependency Injection ("DI")</dt>
    <dd>Formally, "injecting" the objects that fields refer to from outside the class, for example by using constructors
        or setter methods. Contrast to a class creating its own objects with <code>new</code>, like
        <code>class Room { Door door = new Door(); }</code>. In professional programming, we often use dependency
        injection frameworks like Spring to handle dependency injection, so we don't need to add setters or parameters
        to constructors.
    </dd>
    <dt>DOM</dt>
    <dd>DOM means 'Document Object Model': when a webbrowser receives an HTML page, it parses the HTML to create the
        structure of the web page in memory, very similar to how Java code is compiled to executable code in a .class
        file. This DOM can then be displayed on screen.
    </dd>
    <dt>endpoint</dt>
    <dd>An endpoint is a name for the method called in an API by a web browser or other program. For example,
        <code>@GetMapping("{id}") public Optional&lt;Item&gt; getItemName(@PathVariable("id") Long id) { return
            itemRepository.findById(id); }</code> would be called an endpoint.
    </dd>
    <dt>entity class</dt>
    <dd>a class that mostly simply stores data, and is converted to a table in a database. An instance of the entity
        class will usually correspond to a row (or future row) in that table. Entity classes can be contrasted with
        'normal' classes, which often must do things like
        providing calculations/services, or an interaction with the internet, like a controller class does.
    </dd>
    <dt>Gradle</dt>
    <dd>Build automation tool for Java applications; you write a build script in a special programming language,
        the Gradle DSL (DSL=Domain-Specific Language). Since Gradle allows the user to specify steps in a complete
        programming language instead of a 'mere' data format like XML, Gradle is very powerful, but also more complex
        than
        Maven. For large, complicated projects, Gradle, especially with the Kotlin DSL (Gradle has two DSLs, a Groovy
        DSL and a Kotlin DSL) would generally be recommended over Maven.
    </dd>
    <dt>Groovy</dt>
    <dd>A dynamically typed language running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), developed around 2003. While it never
        became very popular, it is an integral part of the first versions of Gradle (Gradle: Groovy DSL), and some of
        its ideas and notations can be found in newer languages like Kotlin.
    </dd>
    <dt>HTTP</dt>
    <dd>HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is one of the many protocols by which you can ask information
        on the internet (the FTP, File Transfer Protocol, is another). HTTP has 'requests' and 'responses'; a client
        computer sends a request, which has a first line containing the request type (like GET or POST or DELETE),
        then lines containing key-value pairs, then an empty line, and finally an optional body containing further
        information. Responses have a
        first
        line that contains a status code (like 200-Success or 500-Server error), but for the rest are identical to
        requests, with key-value pairs, the empty line, and the optional body. Usually, HTTP (or nowadays mostly
        the secure, encrypted version of it, HTTPS) is the way the front-end
        (browser part) and the back-end (server part) of web applications communicate.
    </dd>
    <dt>Jakarta</dt>
    <dd>Next to being the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta is also the name for the framework formerly known as JEE
        (Java Enterprise Edition), which makes it easier to develop commercial applications than the Java SE
        (Standard Edition, which you could always download for free) does by
        providing useful methods for database communication and serving websites and such. When Sun and later Oracle
        developed it, it was called Java EE, but Oracle has decided to stop developing and supporting Java EE
        (likely because it was probably not that profitable) and gave the project to the community; the community-led
        version of JavaEE is called Jakarta, and, in contrast to JavaEE, Jakarta is still updated. This is incidentally
        why, if you use certain dependencies, books and websites often prescribe some javax package, but as the java
        name
        is property of Oracle, the Jakarta project (and anyone else) cannot use it, and many old
        <code>javax.[some_package_name]</code> packages are now called <code>jakarta.[some_package_name]</code>.
        In the direct sense, the Jakarta project is not immediately important to us because we use Spring (which arose
        as a strong competitor to the originally rather cumbersome JEE). In the indirect sense, however, the Jakarta
        project
        <em>is</em> important, as it is the new standard for new developments and extensions to the Java ecosystem;
        even while we use Spring, we will use many Jakarta packages and annotations.
    </dd>
    <dt>JDBC</dt>
    <dd>Java DataBase Connectivity: the basic library that Java uses to communicate with the drivers of DBMSes. JDBC
        is in some sense rather primitive, you write SQL-like statements which JDBC translates into something passed to
        the DBMS drivers. In most cases, this SQL-writing work is rather cumbersome and can, especially in the hands of
        developers who are not database experts, create inefficient or slow code; so most Java developers use the
        higher-level JPA for most
        of their database work. However, in the rare cases where you have a database performance problems and JPA
        commands
        don't optimize the relevant statements well, experts will use JDBC to fine-tune the performance of those
        critical
        pieces.
    </dd>
    <dt>JPA</dt>
    <dd>Jakarta Persistence API (formerly known as Java Persistence API). JPA makes reading from and saving to a
        database possible using 'normal' Java code, instead of forcing the developer to use JDBC´s SQL dialect.
        In most cases, JPA-level code is shorter and clearer than JDBC code, though experienced developers may
        still use JDBC for those commands and queries that are not optimized enough by the JPA methods.
    </dd>
    <dt>JSON</dt>
    <dd>JavaScript Object Notation; way of specifying data where objects are indicated with {}, arrays with [],
        strings with "", numbers and true/false as themselves. [{"name": "Donald Trump", "party": "Republicans",
        "is-president": false},
        {"name": "Joe Biden", "party": "Democrats", "year-elected-president": 2020}] would be a JSON notation with two
        objects
        representing the current
        frontrunners for the 2024 presidential elections in the US.
    </dd>
    <dt>JVM</dt>
    <dd>
        The Java Virtual Machine, which is an interpreter for Java bytecode. The Java Virtual Machine not only makes
        it possible to more easily run Java on a wide variety of machines (since you only need to create a JVM for
        a certain processor/operating system, not a full compiler, which is a lot more work), but also makes it possible
        to perform runtime security checks and garbage collection.
    </dd>
    <dt>Kotlin</dt>
    <dd>
        Another language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Kotlin was created around 2011 by JetBrains, the
        maker of IntelliJ IDEA (and at least half a dozen other IDEs for other programming languages). Currently, Kotlin
        has
        supplanted Java as the primary language for Android development, but it is also occasionally used for back-end
        projects; Spring, for example, has pretty good Kotlin support. There is also a Gradle Kotlin DSL, the successor
        of the Gradle Groovy DSL; due to Kotlin's static typing, the Gradle Kotlin DSL is nowadays recommended, but
        documentation and Stack Overflow answers are still not as developed for the Kotlin DSL as for the Groovy DSL,
        so for now I don't recommend Gradle Kotlin for beginners, even if it is likely the most powerful option for
        large, complex projects.
    </dd>
    <dt>Lombok</dt>
    <dd>Lombok is a library that makes writing simple Java classes easier by providing annotations like @Getter (which
        automatically adds getter methods for all fields of a class). While most editors can also automatically generate
        getter and setter methods, Lombok also makes the code shorter and saves you some shortcut usage whenever you
        add or remove a field. Note, however, that there are recommendations to avoid some Lombok annotations on
        entity classes, mainly <a href="https://jpa-buddy.com/blog/lombok-and-jpa-what-may-go-wrong/">@Data,
            @EqualsAndHashCode, @ToString</a>, and some authors even consider Lombok <a
                href="https://thorben-janssen.com/lombok-hibernate-how-to-avoid-common-pitfalls/">not worth it</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Maven</dt>
    <dd>Build automation tool for Java applications; you write a build script in an XML format. Maven is older than
        Gradle, more verbose, and less flexible; but it is also simpler to learn and use, and there is much more
        guidance on it on Stack Overflow. For a beginner's project, Maven is likely the best. Maven's configuration
        of your project can be found in the pom.xml file.
    </dd>
    <dt>Next.js</dt>
    <dd>Next.js is a JavaScript framework for front-end development. It generally works very much like (if not the same
        as) React, but includes lots of functionality like routing that you have to choose/include/download separately
        if you would make a 'pure' React project.
    </dd>
    <dt>pgAdmin</dt>
    <dd>A program, generally installed with the PostgreSQL DBMS, that allows you to create and modify databases
        using a GUI instead of via SQL commands.
    </dd>
    <dt>port</dt>
    <dd>The word 'port' in computing is -by many users and manufacturers- used to indicate the physical openings of
        a computer system where you attach cables or other items that information is transferred to or from. An example
        would be the USB ports you can find on most modern systems. When <em>software developers</em> talk about ports,
        however, they generally mean a sort of addition to the web address of a system that the operating system uses
        to determine to which program or process a certain piece of information should go. For example, if my computer
        has an IP-address of 192.168.2.4, any request to 192.168.2.4:8080 will be directed to the Tomcat server
        listening to that port for requests to my Spring application, requests to 192.168.2.4:5432 will go to my
        PostgreSQL DBMS, and 192.168.2.4:5173 will redirect requests to my running React application. All the requests
        to these different ports will physically go through my WiFi-adapter (or at least in some manner get sent to
        my operating system), the port determines to which specific
        memory address/process the operating system delivers the data.
    </dd>
    <dt>PostgreSQL</dt>
    <dd>PostgreSQL is one of the major "database management systems" (DBMS) in use today. PostgreSQL, in contrast to
        many other DBMSes, is
        free and open source, and seems to be (in 2023) the <a
                href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-database-prof">most popular
            DBMS</a>
        used by professional developers.
    </dd>
    <dt>PostgreSQL driver</dt>
    <dd>languages like Java communicate with databases via a kind of generic database code, which is not the same as the
        various SQL dialects used by the different DBMSes. Therefore, for each individual DBMS you need to download
        and install a so-called driver, which communicates between the Java code and the DBMS. As we will be using
        PostgreSQL in this project, we need to use the PostgreSQL driver, which can be easily installed via the Spring
        Initializr.
    </dd>
    <dt>React</dt>
    <dd>React is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to create front-ends and web-applications than by using
        'pure'
        JavaScript. While you can make interactive web pages with normal JavaScript, the process is slow and
        error-prone, and performance may not be good. That is why people have developed JavaScript libraries to make
        front-end development easier; first JQuery, then Angular, and later React. React has certain features and also
        'tricks' to make writing interactive websites easier and to make them more performant. First of all, React
        allows you to split your website into reusable parts, called components. These components are comparable to
        classes in object-oriented languages. Second, React offers JSX, JavaScript XML notation, which makes programming
        a component almost as easy as writing HTML code. Third, React has a so-called "Virtual DOM", meaning that
        whenever the webpage must change, React first writes all changes to a copy of the website's DOM in memory, and
        then replaces the real dom with the contents of the virtual DOM; this is much faster than writing changes one
        by one to the DOM. Fourth, to make efficient updating possible, React works with "state": certain
        variables/values are important for a React component, if these variables change, the component is redrawn, else
        it stays the same. This minimizes the number of updates that is performed, and hence also enhances performance.
    </dd>
    <dt>REST API</dt>
    <dd>REST means 'Representational State Transfer'. In practice, we use it mainly for so-called REST APIs, in which
        you send HTTP requests with a body that contain JSON to a web server; the REST API then returns a HTTP response,
        possibly also with a JSON body. REST is not the only protocol used (there are XML-based SOAP and the modern
        GraphQL), but it is the standard for most inter-program communication on the internet.
    </dd>
    <dt>server</dt>
    <dd>A server is a computer or process on that computer that can respond to requests from outside. Generally, a
        server gets requests from other computer programs instead of from direct button presses or mouse clicks,
        like a desktop application does. Usually, a server responds to a certain command in a protocol that the
        server supports, like HTTP or HTTPS or FTP. The program (or computer) that sends the requests to the server
        is generally called the 'client'. In any computing process, the party/program/computer that initiates the
        action is called the client, the party responding to it the server. In a typical web application, the user
        surfs to a page, and the user's browser (called the 'web client') makes a request for the new web page to
        the (web)server; the web server usually makes a request to the database server, in which interaction the
        web server is the client.
    </dd>
    <dt>service</dt>
    <dd>The term "service" in computer programming can mean one of two things. One meaning of a 'service' is a program
        that runs in the background of Windows and that is started and stopped automatically, without users generally
        knowing about its existence. Windows-key + S + "ser" shows a Service overview, where you can see a list
        of services, like "postgresql-x64-15 - PostgreSQL Server 15" which is running the PostgreSQL DBMS, and listens
        to requests to port 5432. In Linux, these processes are called "daemons." The more prevalent meaning, however,
        is of a class that performs some kind of service for another class; typically, a controller class would get a
        request for an item with a certain id, and since (especially in large programs) developers generally consider
        it not too nice to let the controller know where to find the database, many developers will make a service class
        that accesses the database; so the controller gets the request for an item with say id of 3, the controller then
        asks an object of the server class for the item with id 3, the service class then asks an object of the
        repository for the item with id 3, then returns that value to the controller, and the controller returns it to
        the front-end. This may seem overly laborious to you, and for small applications it indeed is. But if
        controllers grow and become more complex (with all kinds of different error messages) and/or the logic of
        writing or retrieving objects becomes more complex, having a separate service class can really make your code
        cleaner and clearer by making it adhere more to the single-responsibility principle.
    </dd>
    <dt>Single-responsibility principle</dt>
    <dd>The Single-responsibility principle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">wikipedia</a>
        ), means that a unit of code, whether that is a line of code, a method, a
        class or even a package, should have one main task and do it well. Code that has multiple responsibilities/does
        multiple things, like <code>int a = b++;</code> which both assigns a value to a <em>and</em> increases b,
        is generally harder to understand and maintain than two lines (or two methods or two classes) that both have
        one clear, separate task. Of course, this 'single responsibility' depends on the level
        of the code, the main method has a far bigger responsibility (running the program) than a method that merely
        reads an item from a database. Note also that software development is an engineering discipline, so even a
        principle like this has cases in which one should not apply it, as being overzealous in separating
        responsibilities can harm maintainability, due to leading to more files. That being said, if code is hard to
        understand despite having relatively short units of code and clear identifier names, it may be that applying the
        single-responsibility principle to it will improve code quality and maintainability.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring</dt>
    <dd>framework that provides a suite of useful libraries that make reading/writing to databases, serving
        web pages, and lots of other things far easier than they would be if you would exclusively use the inbuilt Java
        libraries.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Boot</dt>
    <dd>framework that makes it easier to create a Spring projects. Usually you start a Spring Boot project
        via the "Spring Initialzr" website.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Boot Dev Tools</dt>
    <dd>a libary that allows a 'hot reload' (automatic recompile when you change and save code). Note that if you want
        to use the Spring Boot Dev Tools in IntelliJ, you may also need to
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvIM9gNTDM4">change some IntelliJ settings</a> in order for it to work.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Data JPA</dt>
    <dd>Dependency/project that makes it very easy to read from and write to a database, with much less code than is
        required by the original JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) and JPA (Jakarta Persistence API). Interfaces like
        JpaRepository are part of the Spring Data JPA, though Spring Data JPA also of course implements the
        JPA-specified annotations like @Entity, @Id, @OneToMany and so on.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Initializr</dt>
    <dd>website that makes it easy to create a Spring project; it can be found at <a href="https://start.spring.io/">
        https://start.spring.io/</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Security</dt>
    <dd>Spring Security is a package in Spring that handles authentication, passwords, and logging in and out. These are
        almost always required for web applications.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Web</dt>
    <dd>Dependency/project that makes it easy to create a REST API with Spring, you can use @GetRequest and @PostRequest
        and @RestController to create methods and classes that can process a HTTP request and return a value, also
        via HTTP.
    </dd>
    <dt>Vite</dt>
    <dd>Vite is a tool that can help you create and build frontend applications quickly; see the <a
            href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/">Vite site</a>. I currently use it as a high-quality replacement for
        create-react-app.
