    <title>Key concepts to remember</title>
</head>
<body>
<dl>
    <dt>artifact</dt>
    <dd>The 'name' of this particular project as it would appear in the package; typically a package would be called
        <code>nl.itvitae.springreactdemo</code>. In that, <code>springreactdemo</code> would be the (name of the)
        artifact, <code>nl.itvitae</code> would be called the group. By default, Spring Initializr creates an
        application with a main class whose name is the same as the name of the package, just starting with a capital
        letter. If you don't want that, so if you don't want a 'Springreactdemo' main class but say a 'SpringReactDemo'
        main class, you need to specify that in the 'name' field of the Initializr.
    </dd>
    <dt>database</dt>
    <dd>a database is usually a collection of data, each database is isolated from other databases, like books
        on a library shelf. Databases are generally created and managed by so-called database management systems (DBMS).
    </dd>
    <dt>DBMS</dt>
    <dd>database management system. Basically, a DBMS is software to create, query, update and delete databases
    </dd>
    <dt>dependency</dt>
    <dd>The name of a class or library on which a certain class or software package depends, and therefore usually
        needs to be downloaded to your computer and packaged with the final product. In Java, dependencies on libraries
        are usually managed by specifying which libraries/packages you need via a Maven or Gradle configuration file.
    </dd>
    <dt>Dependency Injection ("DI")</dt>
    <dd>Formally, "injecting" the objects that fields refer to from outside the class, for example by using constructors
        or setter methods. Contrast to a class creating its own objects, with new, like
        <code>class Room { Door door = new Door(); }</code>. In professional programming, we often use dependency
        injection frameworks like Spring to handle dependency injection, so we don't need to add setters or parameters
        to constructors.
    </dd>
    <dt>Gradle</dt>
    <dd>Build automation tool for Java applications; you write a build script in a special programming language,
        the Gradle DSL (DSL=Domain-Specific Language). Since Gradle allows the user to specify steps in a complete
        programming language instead of a regular data format like XML, Gradle is very powerful, but also more complex
        than
        Maven. For large, complicated projects, Gradle, especially with the Kotlin DSL (Gradle has two DSLs, a Groovy
        DSL and a Kotlin DSL) would generally be recommended over Maven.
    </dd>
    <dt>Groovy</dt>
    <dd>A dynamically typed language running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), developed around 2003. While it never
        became very popular, it is an integral part of the first versions of Gradle (Gradle: Groovy DSL), and some of
        its ideas and notations can be found in newer languages like Kotlin.
    </dd>
    <dt>JVM</dt>
    <dd>
        The Java Virtual Machine, which is an interpreter for Java bytecode. The Java Virtual Machine not only makes
        it possible to more easily run Java on a wide variety of machines (since you only need to create a JVM for
        a certain processor/operating system, not a full compiler, which is a lot more work), but also makes it possible
        to perform runtime security checks and garbage collection.
    </dd>
    <dt>Kotlin</dt>
    <dd>
        Another language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Kotlin was created around 2011 by JetBrains, the
        maker of IntelliJ IDEA (and at least half a dozen other IDEs for other languages). Currently, Kotlin has
        supplanted Java as the primary language for Android development, but it is also occasionally used for back-end
        projects; Spring, for example, has pretty good Kotlin support. There is also a Gradle Kotlin DSL, the successor
        of the Gradle Groovy DSL; due to Kotlin's static typing, the Gradle Kotlin DSL is nowadays recommended, but
        documentation and Stack Overflow answers are still not as developed for the Kotlin DSL as for the Groovy DSL,
        so for now I don't recommend Gradle Kotlin for beginners, even if it is likely the most powerful option for
        large, complex projects.
    </dd>
    <dt>Lombok</dt>
    <dd>Lombok is a library that makes writing simple Java classes easier by providing annotations like @Getter that
        automatically adds getter methods to the fields of a class. While most editors can also automatically generate
        getter and setter methods, Lombok also makes the code shorter and saves you some shortcut usage whenever you
        add or remove a field. Note, however, that there are recommendations to avoid some Lombok annotations on
        entity classes, mainly <a href="https://jpa-buddy.com/blog/lombok-and-jpa-what-may-go-wrong/">@Data,
            @EqualsAndHashCode, @ToString</a>, and some authors even consider Lombok <a
                href="https://thorben-janssen.com/lombok-hibernate-how-to-avoid-common-pitfalls/">not worth it</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Maven</dt>
    <dd>Build automation tool for Java applications; you write a build script in an XML format. Maven is older than
        Gradle, more verbose, and less flexible; but it is also simpler to learn and use, and there is much more
        guidance on it on Stack Overflow. For a beginner's project, Maven is likely the best. Maven's configuration
        of your project can be found in the pom.xml file.
    </dd>
    <dt>PostgreSQL</dt>
    <dd>PostgreSQL is one of the major "database management systems" (DBMS) in use today. A DBMS is the software that
        creates, deletes, queries and updates the databases. PostgreSQL, in contrast to many other DBMSes, is
        free and open source, and seems to be (in 2023) the <a
                href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-database-prof">most popular</a>
        database used by professional developers.
    </dd>
    <dt>PostgreSQL driver</dt>
    <dd>languages like Java communicate with databases via a kind of generic database code, which is not the same as the
        various SQL dialects used by the different DBMSes. Therefore, for each individual database you need to download
        and install a so-called driver, which communicates between the Java-code and the database. As we will be using
        PostgreSQL in this project, we need to use the PostgreSQL driver, which can be easily installed via the Spring
        Initializr.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring</dt>
    <dd>framework that provides a suite of useful libraries that make reading/writing to databases, serving
        web pages, and lots of other things far easier that using 'pure' Java. The various libraries and classes
        of the Spring framework are linked together with dependency injection (DI).
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Boot</dt>
    <dd>framework that makes it easier to create a Spring projects. Usually you start a Spring Boot project
        via the "Spring Initialzr" website.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Boot Dev Tools</dt>
    <dd>a libary that allows a 'hot reload' (automatic recompile when you change and save code). Note that if you want
        to use the Spring Boot Dev Tools in IntelliJ, you may also need to
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvIM9gNTDM4">change some IntelliJ settings</a> for it to work.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Data JPA</dt>
    <dd>Dependency/project that makes it very easy to read from and write to a database, with much less code than is
        required by the original JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) and JPA (Jakarta Persistence API). Interfaces like
        JpaRepository are part of the Spring Data JPA, though Spring Data JPA also of course implements the
        JPA-specified annotations like @Entity, @Id, @OneToMany and so on.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Initializr</dt>
    <dd>website that makes it easy to create a Spring project; it can be found at <a href="https://start.spring.io/">
        https://start.spring.io/</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Security</dt>
    <dd>Spring Security is a package in Spring that handles authentication, passwords, and logging in and out, which are
        almost always required for web applications.
    </dd>
    <dt>Spring Web</dt>
    <dd>Dependency/project that makes it easy to create a REST-API with Spring, you can use @GetRequest and @PostRequest
        and @RestController to create methods and classes that can process a HTTP request and return a value, also
        via HTTP.
