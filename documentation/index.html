<p>
    For a Java developer it is a useful skill to be able to develop a full-stack web app. In this tutorial project,
    I will make a full-stack web app with Spring and React, as those are at the time of starting (2023-07-22) the most
    popular frameworks for development in Java and JavaScript, respectively.</p>
