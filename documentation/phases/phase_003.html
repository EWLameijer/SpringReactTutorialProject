<h2>Creating your first endpoint</h2>

<p>Logging in right now only results in a Whitelabel error page. We need to serve some page or data, at some
    endpoint!</p>
<p>Fortunately, that is easy to do in Spring. Four steps are needed for that:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#create_a_class">Create a controller class</a></li>
    <li><a href="#annotate_the_class">Annotate the class with a @RestController</a></li>
    <li><a href="#create_a_method">Create a method in that class that returns some value</a></li>
    <li><a href="#annotate_the_method">Give the method a @GetMapping (or @Post/@Put or other mapping corresponding to an
        HTTP verb). Optionally: add a path to the Mapping annotation.</a>
    </li>
</ol>

Note: I also discuss <a href="#activate-devtools">how to activate DevTools for hot reload in IntelliJ</a>

<h3 id="create_a_class">Create a class</h3>
<p>I simply let IntelliJ create a class called "Controller".</p>
<pre>
public class Controller {
}</pre>

<h3 id="annotate_the_class">Annotate the class with a @RestController</h3>
<p>If you don't annotate the class with @RestController, it won't send HTTP requests to its methods.</p>
<pre>
@RestController
public class Controller {
}</pre>

<h3 id="create_a_method">Create a method in that class that returns some value</h3>
<p>You have to be able to return some information to the browser or program which sends an HTTP request to one of your
    endpoints. This is done via a method with a non-void return value.</p>
<pre>
@RestController
public class Controller {
    public String showWelcome() {
        return "Hello SpringReactTutorialProject!";
    }
}</pre>

<h3 id="annotate_the_method">Give the method a @GetMapping (or @Post/@Put or other mapping corresponding to a HTTP
    verb). Optionally: add a path.</h3>
<p>If I add @GetMapping, a request from the browser to the "empty path" (localhost:8080) will be handled by this
    method. I could also use @GetMapping("welcome"), in which case I would get the message if I went to
    localhost:8080/welcome</p>
<pre>
@RestController
public class Controller {
    @GetMapping
    public String showWelcome() {
        return "Hello SpringReactTutorialProject!";
    }
}</pre>

<h2 id="activate-devtools">Extra: make Spring Boot DevTools work in IntelliJ</h2>
<p>If, like me, you're using IntelliJ community edition, you may have noticed that DevTools, rather than automatically
    reloading the application on each code change, does not actually work! This can be remedied by changing some
    settings in IntelliJ, however, as shown on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvIM9gNTDM4">Youtube</a>.
    In short:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to Settings->Compiler->Build, Execution, Deployment; activate 'Build project automatically'</li>
    <li>Go to Settings->Advanced Settings; activate Allow auto-make to start</li>
</ul>
<p>Now DevTools should work, but allow for 10 seconds or such delay after save.</p>
