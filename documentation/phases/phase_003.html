<h2>Create your first endpoint</h2>


<p>Logging in now only results in a Whitelabel error page. We need to serve some page or data, at some endpoint!</p>
<p>Fortunately, that is easy to do in Spring. Four steps are needed for that:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#create_a_class">Create a class</a></li>
    <li><a href="#annotate_the_class">Annotate the class with a @RestController</a></li>
    <li><a href="#create_a_method">Create a method in that class that returns some value</a></li>
    <li><a href="#annotate_the_method">Give the method a @GetMapping (or @Post/@Put or other mapping corresponding to a HTTP verb). Optionally: add a
        path.</a>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>However, this is easy to do in Spring. We just need to create a class that has some kind of @Controller annotation.
    As I don't want to serve a regular webpage here (we'll use React for that, later), I'll make it a @RestController.
</p>

Note: I also discuss <a href="#activate-devtools">how to activate DevTools for hot reload in IntelliJ</a>

<h3 id="create_a_class">Create a class</h3>
<p>I simply let IntelliJ create a class called "Controller".</p>
<pre>
public class Controller {
}</pre>

<h3 id="annotate_the_class">Annotate the class with a @RestController</h3>
<p>If you don't annotate the class with @RestController, it won't create endpoints.</p>
<pre>
@RestController
public class Controller {
}</pre>

<h3 id="create_a_method">Create a method in that class that returns some value</h3>
<p>You have to be able to give the browser some information when a request is sent. This is done via the return value
    of a method.</p>
<pre>
@RestController
public class Controller {
    public String showWelcome() {
        return "Hello SpringReactTutorialProject!";
    }
}</pre>

<h3 id="annotate_the_method">Give the method a @GetMapping (or @Post/@Put or other mapping corresponding to a HTTP verb). Optionally: add a
    path.</h3>
<p>If I add @GetMapping, a request from the browser to the "empty path" (localhost:8080) will be handled by this
    method. I could also use @GetMapping("welcome"), in which case I would get the message if I went to
    localhost:8080/welcome</p>
<pre>
@RestController
public class Controller {
    @GetMapping
    public String showWelcome() {
        return "Hello SpringReactTutorialProject!";
    }
}</pre>

<h2 id="activate-devtools">Extra: make Spring Boot DevTools work in IntelliJ</h2>
<p>If, like me, you're using IntelliJ community edition, you may have noticed that DevTools, rather than automatically
reloading the application on each code change, does not actually work! This can be remedied by changing some
settings in IntelliJ, however, as shown on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvIM9gNTDM4">youtube</a>. Basically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to Settings->Compiler->Build, Execution, Deployment; activate 'Build project automatically'</li>
    <li>Go to Settings->Advanced Settings; activate Allow auto-make to start</li>
</ul>
<p>Now DevTools should work, but allow for 10 seconds or such delay after save.</p>
