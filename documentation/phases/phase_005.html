<h1>Adding a React front-end: step 1 - let a tool create a React app for you</h1>
<p>
    In programming, a generally useful technique is that of "vertical slicing", which means that the best way to make
    an app is not to create a database, and then some kind of back-end code, and then front-end code, but to work
    feature by feature: first build a feature that a user can see (say, in the front-end), and then let it do something.
    Then build the next feature.
</p>
<p>
    So, it is overdue to create a front-end. Based on a Stack Overflow post I will now modify my repository
    to split it in front-end and back-end folders, as people tend to get confused my multiple 'src' folders in VS
    Code...
</p>

</ol>

<h3 id="move_spring_code">Step 1: move the Spring code to a backend folder</h3>
<p>I simply close IntelliJ, create a folder named 'back-end' in the springreacttutorialproject folder, and move all
    other
    contents of the springreacttutorialproject folder except for .git and documentation to it. I open
    the project again, and after a false start in which IDEA generates an .idea folder at the same level as the back-end
    (this .idea folder I delete) it works!</p>

<h3 id="create_react_app">Step 2: Create a React project</h3>

<p>
    React applications can be created by hand, at least in theory.
    In practice, setting up an app with React is so complicated, that you almost always us a special program for it.
    As with most things in the JavaScript ecosystem, there are many ways to create a React app. I will list some
    of the best-known below: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Create React App - the original one, used in many tutorials, but basically deprecated/unsuitable for use in
        2023
    </li>
    <li>Vite: an App creator that can create apps with many other libraries besides React. It builds your app really
        fast, shortening development time.
    </li>
    <li>Next.js: a React "framework", with lots of functions that React itself does not have</li>
</ol>

<h3>Create-React-App</h3>
<p>Create-React-App is the original React app builder. However, it is not very much maintained anymore, and using it
    will give many security vulnerabilities.
    It's not terrible for hobby projects, but you definitely don't want vulnerabilities in production projects, so it
    is better to use another option to create react apps.
</p>
<h4>Vite</h4>
<p>You can consider Vite the spiritual successor of Create-React-App: it creates React apps, it just does everything
    faster if you allow it to use the SWC
    builder instead of the default Babel/Webpack. Definitely a better option than Create-React-App.
</p>
<h4>Next.js</h4>
<p>React was always promoted as a library, which helped developers with a few core things, but gave them the
    freedom to pick and choose complementary
    JavaScript libraries for specific functionality, like routing. However, many developers prefer all-included
    solutions. Next.js is such a 'batteries-included' solution. In contrast to React, Next.js is really not a library
    anymore, but more of a framework, comparable to for example Angular.
</p>
<p>Is that good? Should you use a library or a framework? In software design, it is said, there are no solutions,
    only tradeoffs. If you had to choose between
    Vite and Next.js:
<ul>
    <li>Vite: advantages: has faster build time so regular development will likely go a bit faster. Allows you to
        import other libraries, so you can adapt the program
        better to specific needs.
    </li>
    <li>Next.js: You don't need to spend time looking for specific libraries and hope they play nicely together.</li>
</ul>

<p>What to choose? For a relatively simple app, Next.js is likely the easiest choice. The build speed and versatily of
    Vite are only a major advantage on large projects.
    So for a demo app like this, Next.js might be a slightly better choice; but as a majority of projects still use
    React and Vite may make builds a bit
    more quickly, I'll use Vite here; I once had to include a routing library, which was not that hard. But
    basically this decision could be defended either way,
    I would not argue strongly against someone who wanted to make a demo app in Next.js.
</p>

<h2>What does React do, exactly?</h2>
<p>I have said above that React is a library, not a framework. But a library for what, exactly? After all, you can make
    fully interactive websites in "vanilla"
    JavaScript, no frameworks/libraries needed.</p>
<p>However, regular JavaScript websites have some problems. First, they tend to become huge html-files and
    scripts of hundreds of lines of code,
    making it hard to find the part of functionality that needs to be modified or debugged. Second, it is easy
    for them to change data somewhere
    and not update the data on all places where it is needed in the browser. Third, even if you update data in the
    browser, it is far too easy to do that by
    producing buggy, slow code.
</p>
<p>The React library aims to alleviate these problems.</p>

<p> React encourages you to make your app consist not one one large blob of HTML/JS, but out of many smaller
    components, which you can combine like lego blocks (or classes in other programming languages, like Java). In fact,
    the original React versions offered
    classes inheriting from <code>React.Component</code> as the basis of those components (nowadays we mostly use functions,
    so-called 'functional components').
</p>
<p>Next, React makes it easier to update everything correctly as values change. For that, React uses so-called
    "state". Components can have state, which basically is a set of variables that are 'watched over' by React, and
    when the state of a component changes, React redraws -or, as it is usually called, 're-renders'- the component.
</p>
<p>Finally, React does its best to make the software fast; it redraws components as efficiently as possible and as
    little as possible, keeping account
    of the state. To work optimally, it may make further demands of your code, like giving each item in a list a
    unique key, but overall the updating works
    smoothly. This is also because React uses a trick called the "Virtual DOM", in which all changes are drawn, and
    which
    is then wholesale written to the browser-
    whereas normal JavaScript does every update separately in the browser, which is a slower process.
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Go to the folder in which you want to create a folder hosting the React application - in my case the
    springreacttutorialproject folder
    (in Windows Explorer: change the
    address bar of the window, which usually shows something like `C:\GoogleDrive221122` into `cmd` and then press
    ENTER).
</p>
<p>Then run:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <pre>npm create vite@latest</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the name of the project, for example
        <pre>front-end</pre>
        <p>This creates the front-end folder you need.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Choose the other values, like
        <code>React</code>.
        I would also recommend the <code>JavaScript + SWC</code>
        option. (TypeScript is also a good option but a bit more complicated, so for this introduction I'll stick with
        JavaScript)
    </li>
    <li>Follow the instructions. In my case:
        <pre>
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev</pre>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>I now go to http://127.0.0.1:5173/ where a default app with counting button is displayed!</p>
