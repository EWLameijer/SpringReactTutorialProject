<h3 id="use-spring-init">Use Spring Initializr to set up the project</h3>

<p>Creating a Spring project is most easily done with Spring Boot. Spring even provides a website, the "Spring
    Initializr",
    on <a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a>.</p>
<p>I go to the start.spring.io website and fill in the fields, like setting a name for my project
    (SpringReactTutorialProject),
    an artifact (springreacttutorialproject) giving it a group (in my case org.ericwubbo) and a description.

    Note that the artifact, as per best practice, is lowercase only. Since it would be inconvenient if the main class
    would
    simply be called `Springreacttutorialproject` (just starting with a S, the rest NOT camelcased), it is helpful to
    override the name to look like a proper Java class without IntelliJ warnings.
</p>
<p>Some of my settings</p>
<ol>
    <li>Project: <em>Maven</em> (standard would be Gradle Groovy). Why change from the default? Definitely, Gradle has
        "\
        been 'adopt' <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar/tools/gradle">since 2013</a>, and nowadays
        ThoughtWorks even <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-sg/radar/languages-and-frameworks/gradle-kotlin-dsl">
            recommends</a> the Gradle Kotlin variety. However, the power and flexibility of Gradle comes at the price
        of complexity, and most documentation in my experience still uses Maven examples. With the current relative
        absence
        of Gradle Kotlin on Stack Overflow, and my own not-that-developed Gradle knowledge, Maven will be fine enough;
        if I
        ever plan to make a big, complex project, preferably with the help of others, Gradle-Kotlin would seem the way
        to go; but for a proof-of-concept and for exploring Spring itself, Maven it will be for this project.
    </li>
    <li>Language: <em>Java</em>. Groovy seems
        <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=java%2Ckotlin%2Cgroovy">barely used anymore</a>,
        Kotlin is definitely an interesting option, but as I'm teaching Java at the moment, a Java example project is
        nicer for demoing purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
        other defaults: taken without comment. Fine for a first project.
    </li>
</ol>
But we still need some dependencies: Spring Initializr's value is mainly in how easy it is to connect useful libraries
and frameworks. I'll pick six, this time.
<ul>
    <li><em>Spring Web</em>: After all, we need to create some kind of API for a full-stack web app!</li>
    <li><em>Spring Data JPA</em>: Any nontrivial app requires storage, and databases are usually best for that</li>
    <li><em>PostgreSQL Driver</em>: We also need an actual database to connect to via JPA, PostgreSQL seems at the
        moment
        (2023) <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#databases">the most-used database</a> and is quite loved
        as well!
    </li>
    <li><em>Spring Security</em>: In most web apps, you need to remember users.</li>
    <li><em>Lombok</em>: Library to make Java code shorter, which is generally a bonus.</li>
    <li><em>Spring Boot DevTools</em>: Handy library that allows hot reloads.</li>
</ul>

I press the "Generate"-button, download the zip-file, and unpack it into a subfolder of my Development folder.

<h3 id="open-the-project">Open in IntelliJ</h3>
<p>I open the project in IntelliJ, and let Maven do its stuff. I build and run. It runs, though aborts with a message that
it cannot find a database. I'll fix that later. First I'll commit.</p>

<h3 id="push-to-github">Push to GitHub</h3>
<p>I choose VCS from the main menu, Share on GitHub, and push!</p>
